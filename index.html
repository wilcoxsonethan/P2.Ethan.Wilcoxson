        Project 2 - Magic Mirror
    </h2>
    <p>
        Below is my original design for my mirror. I believe it incorporates all the required elements are demonstrates
        a good way to design the smart mirror. It will show the weather, including both temperatures and the conditions currently and
        upcoming conditions. Additionally, the mirror shows a breakdown of a daily schedule which can be changed day to day.
        The mirror always keeps track of the user's current weight and previous weights along with the time of the user's sleep.
        Along the bottom, it includes a updating summary of the top news events along with the author and the source of the information.
        The mirror always has a clock and date built it for easy viewing and can sync with your phone to retrieve text messages,
        emails, and allow you to play music.

        Below is my implementation of the design I created. As you can see most elements from my sketch made it into the final
        design. The only element that I didn't implement was the phone widget allowing to view texts, emails, and play music.
        However, all the other elements were included. The weather widget uses an API for the current temperature and conditions and
        upcoming temperature and conditions in Lubbock. These are updated as the weather forecast is updated. Additionally,
        the news section at the bottom uses the New York Times API to list the current top 3 news stories and is updated automatically
        periodically. The time and date are accurate and update as you are using the mirror. Additionally, both the personal schedule
        element and the health information elements use JSON to receive data to display. Updating the JSON files will update the information
        displayed on screen.
